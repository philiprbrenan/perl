=head1 Name

Data::Edit::Conversion - Perform a restartable series of steps in parallel.

=head1 Synopsis

Launch the conversion of several files, each represented by a project, in
parallel processes, saving the project state after each step of the conversion
so that subsequent conversions can be restarted at later steps to speed up
development by bypassing initial processing steps unless they are really
needed. The L<data|/data> and L<stepTimes|/stepTimes> are transferred back
from each project's sub process to the main calling process so that the main
process can further process their results.

=head1 Description

Perform a restartable series of steps in parallel.

The following sections describe the methods in each functional area of this
module.  For an alphabetic listing of all methods by name see L<Index|/Index>.



=head1 Methods

Specify and run the restartable conversion of zero or more files in parallel

=head2 new(@)

Create a conversion specification for zero or more files represented by projects.

     Parameter    Description                                  
  1  @attributes  L</Launch attributes> describing the launch  

This is a static method and so should be invoked as:

  Data::Edit::Conversion::new


=head2 launch($$$)

Launch the conversion of several files, each represented by a project, in parallel processes, saving the project state after each step of the conversion so that subsequent conversions can be restarted at later steps to speed up development by bypassing initial processing steps unless they are really needed. The L<data|/data> and L<stepTimes|/stepTimes> are transferred back from each project's sub process to the main calling process so that the main process can further process their results.

     Parameter  Description                                  
  1  $launch    Launch specification                         
  2  $title     Optional title                               
  3  $restart   Optional name of latest step to restart at.  

=head2 restart($$$)

Launch the conversion of several files represented by projects in parallel, starting at the specified step: the L<data|/data> from the previous step will be restored unless it does not exist in which case the conversion will be run from the latest step available prior to this step or right from the start.

     Parameter  Description           
  1  $launch    Launch specification  
  2  $restart   Step to restart at    
  3  $title     Optional title        

=head1 Launch Attributes

Use these attributes to configure a launch.

=head2 convert :lvalue

I [[step name => sub]...] A list of steps and their associated subs to process that step. At the end of each step the data stored on L<data|/data> is saved to allow for a later restart at the next step.


=head2 maximumNumberOfProcesses :lvalue

I Maximum number of processes to run in parallel


=head2 out :lvalue

I Optional file output area.  This area will be cleared at the start of each launch.


=head2 outFileLimit :lvalue

=head2 projects :lvalue

I A reference to a hash of Data::Edit::Conversion::Project definitions. This can be most easily created by using L<loadProjectsFromFolder|/loadProjectsFromFolder>.


=head2 save :lvalue

I Temporary files will be stored in this folder


=head2 stepNumberByName :lvalue

O Get the number of a step from its name


=head2 stepsByNumber :lvalue

O Array of steps to be performed. The subs in this array call the user supplied subs after approriate set up and then do the required set down after the execution of each step.


=head2 loadProjectsFromFolder($@)

Create a project for file in and below the specified folder and return the projects created

     Parameter    Description                            
  1  $dir         Folder to search                       
  2  @extensions  List of file extensions to search for  

This is a static method and so should be invoked as:

  Data::Edit::Conversion::loadProjectsFromFolder


=head2 projectData($$)

     Parameter     Description           
  1  $launch       Launch specification  
  2  $projectName  Project               

=head2 projectSteps($$)

Get the L<steps times|/stepTimes> showing the executed time in seconds for each step in a project after a launch has completed. If a step name is not present in this hash then the step was not run.

     Parameter     Description           
  1  $launch       Launch specification  
  2  $projectName  Project
