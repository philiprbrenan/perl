=head1 Description

Parse a Unisyn expression.


Version "20211013".


The following sections describe the methods in each functional area of this
module.  For an alphabetic listing of all methods by name see L<Index|/Index>.



=head1 Create

Create a Unisyn parse of a utf8 string.

=head2 create($address, %options)

Create a new unisyn parse from a utf8 string.

     Parameter  Description
  1  $address   Address of a zero terminated utf8 source string to parse as a variable
  2  %options   Parse options.

B<Example:>



    create (K(address, Rutf8 $Lex->{sampleText}{vav}))->print;                    # Create parse tree from source terminated with zero  # 𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲


    ok Assemble(debug => 0, eq => <<END);
  Assign: 𝑎
    Term
      Variable: 𝗮
    Term
      Variable: 𝗯
  END


=head1 Parse

Parse Unisyn expressions

=head1 Traverse

Traverse the parse tree

=head2 traverseParseTree($parse)

Traverse the terms in parse tree in post order and call the operator subroutine associated with each term.

     Parameter  Description
  1  $parse     Parse tree

B<Example:>


    my $s = Rutf8 $Lex->{sampleText}{Adv};                                        # Ascii
    my $p = create K(address, $s), operators => \&printOperatorSequence;

    K(address, $s)->outCStringNL;
    $p->dumpParseTree;
    $p->print;

    $p->traverseParseTree;  # 𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲
